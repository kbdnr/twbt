# Twbt

A basic twitter bot written in python 2.7.  Easily adaptable, crappily authenticated.

# Purpose

This was developed during my finals week as a proof of concept for throwing together a twitter bot quickly.  Oauth methods need improvement, but overall this is a working product.  Currently running live (most of the time)
