# Twbt

A basic twitter bot script using python.  Easily adaptable, crappily authenticated.

# Purpose

This was developed during my finals week as a proof of concept for throwing together a twitter bot quickly.  Oauth methods need improvement, but overall this is a working product.  Currently running live (most of the time) @_s_p_e_d_

# Requirements

* python-twitter api wrapper
* requests (great http library)
* oauth credentials
